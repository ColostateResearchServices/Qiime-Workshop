Working on how this could work on rstudio
Below is information discovered thus far.
This has not yet been successful in testing.

#originally expected this to work.
install.packages('tidyverse','mctoolsr','knitr','xlsx','BiodiversityR','phyloseq','ggplot2', dependencies=TRUE)

install.packages('BiodiversityR','phyloseq', dependencies=TRUE)

### BiocManager helps with packages and dependencies let's try leaning on this a little?

## Troubleshooting biocmanager issues with R version and library versions
#blocmanager has to match R verison, R4.2.2 needs 3.16
## Biocmanager install information: https://www.bioconductor.org/install/
#BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")
#BiocManager::install("DESeq2", version = "3.16")

## maybe useful for phyloseq pkg?

## *Testing* SETUP NOW ####
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(version = "3.16")

BiocManager::install("FEAST", version = "3.16")
BiocManager::install("phyloseq", version = "3.16")

### *CHECK* ENV ####
## Checking from 'R" the installed packages
Method 1: Check if Particular Package is Installed
#check if ggplot2 is installed
system.file(package='ggplot2')

#### check pkgs from outside 'r' using flight check? Does this 'see' rstudio environment?
echo "Check FEAST software is installed."
Rscript -e 'if ("FEAST" %in% installed.packages()) { print("FEAST is installed.") } else { print("FEAST is not installed.") }'
Rscript -e 'if ("tidyverse" %in% installed.packages()) { print("tidyverse is installed.") } else { print(" tidyverse is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("mctoolsr" %in% installed.packages()) { print("mctoolsr is installed.") } else { print("mctoolsr is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("knitr" %in% installed.packages()) { print("knitr is installed.") } else { print(" knitr is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("xlsx" %in% installed.packages()) { print("xlsx is installed.") } else { print("xlsx is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("BiodiversityR" %in% installed.packages()) { print("BiodiversityR is installed.") } else { print("BiodiversityR is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("phyloseq" %in% installed.packages()) { print("phyloseq is installed.") } else { print("phyloseq is not installed.") }'

Rscript -e 'if ("ggplot2" %in% installed.packages()) { print("ggplot2 is installed.") } else { print("ggplot2 is not installed.") }'

## SET THE WORKING DIRECTORY
# The first thing we need to do is set our working directory - change $USER to your own account, in my case marinanc@colostate.edu
setwd("/scratch/alpine/$USER")

# Check that we are in the appropriate working directory
getwd()
# The console (bottom left panel) should show the following directory "/scratch/alpine/$USER"

##Format to copy and paste into rstudio 'install' dialogue box###
Rcpp,RcppArmadillo,vegan,dplyr,reshape2,gridExtra,ggplot2,ggthemes,devtools,tidyr,tibble,tidyverse,mctoolsr,knitr,xlsx,ggplot2
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("leffj/mctoolsr")

## INSTALLING PACKAGES NEEDED TO RUN FEAST
# Now that we're within the Scratch directory, we'll install and load all packages needed to run FEAST:
# To do so, first we have to create an object with the different packages that FEAST requires:
Packages <- c("Rcpp", "RcppArmadillo", "vegan", "dplyr", "reshape2", "gridExtra", "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "devtools", "tidyr", "tibble")
# NOTE: after running this command, you will see that this list shows under your "Environment" panel (top right panel)


# Install the packages. You will see a lot of red messages in the console (bottom left panel). 
# Don't panic, that's totally normal! It just means that R is installing the packages needed
# NOTE: this should take a few minutes
install.packages(Packages)
# Load the required packages we just installed
lapply(Packages, library, character.only = TRUE)
#Once done, the installed packages will show in the bottom right panel of the RScript interface, under the "Packages" tab, with a check mark

## Install the FEAST package from GitHub (you can see all the info here: https://github.com/cozygene/FEAST?tab=readme-ov-file)
# Note: this will take a few minutes!
devtools::install_github("cozygene/FEAST", force=TRUE)
# FEAST should now be listed under your installed packages (bottom right panel - Packages tab)

# Load the FEAST package so it's ready to use!
library(FEAST)
